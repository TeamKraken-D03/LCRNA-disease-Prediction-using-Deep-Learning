# lncRNA-Disease Association Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods

**Authors**: Naren Sundar L, Renny Harlin, Vatturu Pardheev, Charuvarthan T

This project focuses on predicting associations between **lncRNAs** (long non-coding RNAs) and diseases using machine learning techniques. By analyzing biological data, the project aims to identify patterns and relationships that can help in better understanding the role of lncRNAs in disease progression and diagnosis.

## Project Details

- **Objective**: Develop a machine learning-based system to predict lncRNA-disease associations.

## Academic Context

This project is part of our 4th Semester **B.Tech Artificial Intelligence and Engineering (AIE)** coursework. It was undertaken for the subjects:

- **22BIO211 Intelligence of Biological Systems**
- **22AIE212 Design and Analysis of Algorithms**

**Institution**: Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore
