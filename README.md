# lncRNA-Disease Association Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods

**Authors**: [Your Names Here]

This project focuses on predicting associations between **lncRNAs** (long non-coding RNAs) and diseases using machine learning techniques. By analyzing biological data, the project aims to identify patterns and relationships that can help in better understanding the role of lncRNAs in disease progression and diagnosis.

## Project Details

- **Objective**: Develop a machine learning-based system to predict lncRNA-disease associations with high accuracy.
- **Key Components**:
  - Feature extraction and preprocessing of biological datasets.
  - Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
  - Evaluation of model performance and validation with existing datasets.
